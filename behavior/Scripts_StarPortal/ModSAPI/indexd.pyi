    A BlockVolume is a simple interface to an object which represents a 3D rectangle of a given size (in blocks) at a world block location.

    In addition, these vector positions are not interchangeable with BlockLocation.

    If you want to get this volume represented as range of of BlockLocations, you can use the getBoundingBox utility function.

    This volume class will maintain the ordering of the corner indexes as initially set. imagine that each corner is assigned in Editor - as you move the corner around (potentially inverting the min/max relationship of the bounds) - what

    you had originally selected as the top/left corner would traditionally become the bottom/right.

    When manually editing these kinds of volumes, you need to maintain the identity of the corner as you edit - the BlockVolume utility functions do this.

    Important to note that this measures block sizes (to/from) - a normal AABB (0,0,0) to (0,0,0) would traditionally be of size (0,0,0)
